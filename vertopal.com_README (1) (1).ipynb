    "In this project you will write a program that stores graphs. Graphs were\n",
    "covered in CMSC 132, so you should be familiar with them and the\n",
    "different representations that can be used for storing them, so we don’t\n",
    "explain these here. You can refer to your 132 materials to refresh your\n",
    "memory of graphs if you need to. Your program must use only\n",
    "dynamically–allocated memory to store graphs. The purpose of the project\n",
    "is to get more experience using memory allocation, and to create a more\n",
    "complex linked data structure in C. Be sure to read the data structure\n",
    "requirements in Section 3 carefully. You will have to write a makefile\n",
    "that will compile your code with all of the public tests, so you will\n",
    "get more practice with makefiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a more difficult project again– perhaps more challenging\n",
    "than Project #3– so start working hard on it right away. Note that the\n",
    "next project will rely upon this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before asking for debugging help in the TAs’ office hours, you must know\n",
    "how to use gdb and have already used gdb to throughly debug your code.\n",
    "Otherwise the TAs will not help figure out any problems with your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will lose credit if any of your functions cast the return value of\n",
    "the memory allocation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the size of the course it is not feasible for us to be able to\n",
    "provide project information or help via email/ELMS messages, so we will\n",
    "be unable to answer such questions. You are welcome to ask any questions\n",
    "verbally during the TAs’ office hours.\n",

    "1.1 Extra credit and number of submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can again get extra credit for this project. If you make only one\n",
    "submission that passes all the public tests you will get 3 extra–credit\n",
    "bonus points. And if your single submission is made at least 48 hours\n",
    "before the on–time deadline you will get 3 additional extra credit bonus\n",
    "points, for 6 extra credit points total. (Obviously you can’t get the\n",
    "second 3 extra credit points if you don’t get the first 3, but you can\n",
    "get the first 3 without getting these second 3.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as before, if you make too many submissions you may again lose\n",
    "credit. To avoid making submissions that don’t compile or don’t pass all\n",
    "of the public tests you should compile the tests, run them, check your\n",

    "2 Graphs in this project\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs in this project are directed. (An undirected graph can be\n",
    "simulated by a directed graph where every undirected edge is replaced by\n",
    "two directed edges, one in each direction.) Henceforth, the term edge\n",
    "means a directed edge. Graphs in this project will have the following\n",
    "properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • There can be at most one edge from a vertex x to a vertex y. (Of course, there can be another edge from y to x.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    • There can be at most one edge from a vertex x to itself. (The edge would be both outgoing and incoming for x.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    • A vertex can have no edges at all, either incoming or outgoing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Every vertex has a name, which is a (possibly empty) string with any length. Hence the name must be stored in dynamically–allocated memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • No two vertices in the same graph can have the same name, but vertices in different graphs can have the same names.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Every edge has a nonnegative integer weight or cost (which could be 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "    • There is no limit to the number of vertices or to the number of edges that graphs can have. Hence vertices and edges must be stored in dynamically–allocated memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will create your own data structure for storing the components of\n",
    "graphs. Our provided header file string-graph.h has the prototypes of\n",
    "the required functions, which use an undefined type String_graph. (It is\n",
    "named String_graph because it is a graph in which the data associated\n",
    "with vertices is character strings.) string-graph.h includes a header\n",
    "file string-graph-datastructure.h that is not provided. You must write\n",
    "this file (with its name spelled exactly as shown), containing your\n",
    "definition of String_graph. Please read carefully because you would lose\n",
    "significant credit if your data structure in\n",
    "string-graph-datastructure.h does not obey these requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • It must use only dynamically–allocated data structures to store graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of dynamically allocated data structures are linked lists,\n",
    "binary search trees, and dynamically– allocated arrays, whose size is\n",
    "not known at compile time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • You must use some type of dynamically–allocated data structure to store the vertices of graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vertex must have a pointer (or pointers) to a separate\n",
    "dynamically–allocated data structure that stores the outgoing edges of\n",
    "the vertex. In particular, you must represent graphs using either an\n",
    "adjacency list, an adjacency set, or an adjacency map. You may not use\n",
    "an adjacency matrix, an edge list, or an incidence matrix, some of which\n",
    "may not even have been covered in CMSC 132. You may not use any graph\n",
    "representation other than one of these three. This also means you may\n",
    "not invent your own graph representation. You must use either an\n",
    "adjacency list, an adjacency set, or an adjacency map.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • You must use at least one binary search tree or one linked list in storing graphs. You can use more than one of these. You can use other dynamically–allocated data structures, such as dynamically–allocated arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • You may not use any fixed–size arrays anywhere in your entire graph implementation. This means there should not be any square braces ([]) anywhere in your header file string-graph-datastructure.h. All strings used for vertex names must use dynamically–allocated memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency list, set, and map graph representations were covered in\n",
    "CMSC 132. You can refer to your 132 materials to refresh your memory of\n",
    "them if needed. Of course lists, sets, and maps are already present in\n",
    "the Java libraries, but not in C. However, CMSC 132 discussed (to\n",
    "varying extents, in some cases in significant detail) how to implement\n",
    "all of these. Note that lecture this semester showed a skeleton of a\n",
    "graph representation but it was incomplete because it didn’t show how\n",
    "the collection of vertices were being stored. You can base your\n",
    "representation upon that, for example by storing the vertices in a\n",
    "binary search tree, a linked list, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the skeleton graph representation shown in class was for an\n",
    "adjacency list, which you don’t have to use– you could use an adjacency\n",
    "map or an adjacency set instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to use (at least one) linked list, recall from CMSC 132\n",
    "that there are many variations of lists (singly– linked, doubly–linked,\n",
    "tail reference, circularly–linked, extra dummy head node or sentinel,\n",
    "etc.). You may use any linked list variations that you like, and may use\n",
    "several linked list variations in combination. If you choose to use an\n",
    "adjacency map, recall that CMSC 132 discussed implementing maps using\n",
    "binary search trees, and you should have already written a binary search\n",
    "tree in Java in CMSC 132.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any doubts about whether you are violating these\n",
    "requirements you can discuss your planned design with the TAs during\n",
    "their office hours before starting to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no requirements for your own tests– we won’t even be looking\n",
    "at them– so these restrictions do not apply to your tests, only to your\n",
    "graph implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not be graded directly on execution efficiency, but if your\n",
    "graph representation is very inefficient (in particular for large\n",
    "graphs), you might fail some tests and therefore lose credit for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Compiling using make\n",
    "\n",
    "You must write a makefile, which will be used on the submit server to\n",
    "compile your code for all the public tests, so it must have a rule for\n",
    "each public test present in the project tarfile. Since you won’t know\n",
    "how many secret tests there are, or what their dependencies should be,\n",
    "we will use our own makefile to compile them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not wait to write your makefile. Write it first– before you even\n",
    "start writing your code. (That is why this section appears before the\n",
    "required functions are even described.) Writing your makefile first will\n",
    "preclude the need to\n",
    "\n",
    "© 2023 L. Herman; all rights reserved 2 type commands for compiling the\n",
    "public tests, so you can save time and avoid making mistakes. Much more\n",
    "importantly, mistakes in writing a makefile can cause your code to not\n",
    "compile correctly– or to compile right on Grace, but not on the submit\n",
    "server. Writing your makefile first and using it all during development,\n",
    "every time you compile your code, will allow you to ensure it works\n",
    "right. So what you should do is to read the rest of this assignment to\n",
    "understand what you have to do, look at the public tests and figure out\n",
    "how they would have to be compiled and what their dependencies are, then\n",
    "write your makefile first. Then write your String_graph definition in\n",
    "string-graph-datastructure.h, and in it write the functions whose\n",
    "prototypes are in string-graph.h. The requirements for your makefile\n",
    "are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • It must be in a file named Makefile (with a capital first letter). (Your code will not compile on the submit server if your makefile name is wrong.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    • It must use the five gcc options -ansi, -pedantic-errors, -Wall, -fstack-protector-all, and -Werror, which were mentioned in the first project, to build object files. (But do not use these options to create executable files.) It does not matter if your makefile contains -g (to be able to run gdb along with these required options.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Your Makefile must contain the following targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "all: This target must appear first and must create executables for all\n",
    "the public tests (and only for the public tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "string-graph.o: This target must create the object file for\n",
    "string-graph.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "an object file for each public test source file: Because your makefile\n",
    "is required to use separate compilation, it will need to create an\n",
    "object file for each public test source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that different tests will have different dependencies, which you\n",
    "can see by looking at what they include; in particular, some object\n",
    "files will depend on compare-vertex-lists.h but others will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "an executable for each public test: Your makefile will need to have a\n",
    "separate target to build each public test executable. These targets must\n",
    "have names ending in .x (public01.x, public02.x, etc.) and must build\n",
    "executables with the same filenames as those targets. (Your code will\n",
    "not work on the submit server if your makefile has incorrect target\n",
    "names or builds executables with the wrong names.) By looking at the\n",
    "source file for each public test you can see what object files have to\n",
    "be linked together to create it; some of them will require\n",
    "compare-vertex-lists.o to be linked as part of the executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because your makefile is required to use separate compilation, it must\n",
    "link the appropriate object files necessary to build each executable,\n",
    "not directly compile multiple source files together to form executables.\n",
    "So there should never be more than one source (.c) file in any\n",
    "compilation command in your makefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "As above, different tests will have different dependencies and will\n",
    "require different object files to be linked together to create their\n",
    "executable.\n",

    "clean: This target must remove the object files and executables for all\n",
    "the public tests and string-graph.o from the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Your makefile may contain additional targets, for example to build your own tests, as long as it has the targets described above. However, do not add any of your own tests to the all target, because things may not work on the submit server if you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Your makefile should not directly compile header files in compilation commands (e.g., do not have compilation commands like gcc -c string-graph.c string-graph.h), or you will lose credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Your makefile should have all needed dependencies, otherwise programs may not get built correctly, but it should not have any unnecessary dependencies, because that would lead to unnecessary compilations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Do not have a target in your makefile to create compare-vertex-lists.o, because you are not being given its source file compare-vertex-lists.c. Just use compare-vertex-lists.o in the linking rules for tests that call the function compare_vertex_lists(), without having a rule creating the object file. But your makefile must recompile anything that uses this object file if it were to change (for example, if we were to give you a new version of compare-vertex-lists.o to fix a bug).\n",
    "\n",
    "And if any files include compare-vertex-lists.h they must be recompiled\n",
    "if this header file were to be changed as well. (Even though you should\n",
    "not change it, we could need to give you a new version of it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "© 2023 L. Herman; all rights reserved 3 • Your clean target should\n",
    "remove all object files other than compare-vertex-lists.o. (If your\n",
    "makefile re-moved compare-vertex-lists.o that would just force you to\n",
    "extract it again from the project tarfile after run-ning make clean.) So\n",
    "don’t use a wildcard in your clean target to remove \\*.o (instead just\n",
    "explicitly list all the object files that should be removed).\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Make has many features that were not explained in class, because they are difficult for a beginner to use correctly. You may only use the features of make that were covered in class. If you use features not explained in class your code may not compile on the submit server for reasons not worth explaining, and the TAs can not help fix makefiles using features not covered. Also, you would lose credit for using any makefile features not covered in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every past student who tried to use advanced features of make in\n",
    "this course made mistakes. So you should write a simple and\n",
    "straightforward makefile, using just the features of make that were\n",
    "covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no makefile with your submission, or if your makefile does\n",
    "not satisfy these requirements, either your program will not compile at\n",
    "all on the submit server, or it might compile for the public tests but\n",
    "not for the secret tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting, you must run make clean, then run the separate\n",

    "ensure your makefile builds all the public tests correctly. (Use these\n",
    "sepa-rate commands, not make or make all.) Your makefile has to able to\n",
    "build the tests like this on the submit server– meaning when there are\n",
    "no executable or object files in the current directory– so test it in\n",
    "the same situation to ensure it works right then.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, your Makefile must use separate compilation– each source\n",
    "file needed to form an executable must be separately compiled, then the\n",
    "independent object files linked together, to form the executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Functions to be written\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions you have to write must be in the file string-graph.c. The\n",

    "parameter or return a value. Some notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • If a pointer passed into a parameter of any function is NULL, the function should not change anything, and (with two exceptions) if it returns an integer value it should return 0. (To avoid repetition this is stated just once here, but don’t forget about it when writing the functions.) Note that the last two functions described below should return different values if NULL is passed into their pointers parameters, as will be pointed out in their descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • It should be possible for a program that calls your functions to create multiple graphs and they should not conflict. In other words, initializing or modifying one graph should not affect any others in the same program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write one function at a time (entirely or even partially), then test it\n",
    "thoroughly (as soon as possible) before going on! Write and test helper\n",
    "functions (i.e., utility functions for your data structures) before\n",

    "\n",
    "This function should initialize its graph parameter, causing it to be an\n",

    "\n",
    "        ◦ Write helper functions for manipulating your data structure, that are called from the required functions. If you find you are writing duplicative code in more than one function, stop and turn it into a helper function. If you find that are you are starting to write any function that is longer than 25–30 lines of code stop and carefully consider if you can factor out part of it into a helper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ Carefully read the data structure requirements in Section 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the recent linked list examples, which are in \\~/216public,\n",
    "the list head pointer (and the tail pointer that one example had) were\n",
    "not themselves dynamically allocated. But all of the list nodes, the\n",
    "first of which is pointed to by the head pointer, were dynamically\n",
    "allocated. Also note that while the example linked lists are storing\n",
    "integers, the integer field of each node was not individually\n",
    "dynamically allocated– it is just inside a node that was dynamically\n",
    "allocated. These examples illustrate what is meant by a data structure\n",
    "that uses only dynamically–allocated memory– that all of the actual\n",
    "nodes of the linked lists are dynamically allocated in the heap, but not\n",
    "necessarily every field of each node. (Of course fields of some types\n",
    "must be dynamically allocated, as explained in Section 3.)\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ Your submission consists of three required user–written files, Makefile, string-graph-datastructure.h, and string-graph.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ Be sure to reread the data structure requirements in Section 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ Recall that the beginning of Section 5 says what the functions should do if parameters are NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ Be careful not to have any pointer aliasing in writing your functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ Do not write code using loops (or recursion) that has the same effect as any string library functions. If you need to perform an operation on strings and there is a string library function already written that accomplishes that task, you are expected to use it, otherwise you will lose credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ You will lose credit if any of your functions cast the return value of the memory allocation functions. Besides being completely unnecessary, in some cases this can mask certain errors in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ◦ You cannot modify anything in the header files string-graph.h or compare-vertex-lists.h, or add anything to them, because your submission will be compiled on the submit server using our versions of these files. You cannot write any new header files of your own other than string-graph-datastructure.h.\n",

    "You may not add any source (.c) files other than string-graph.c, so all\n",

    "features that have been covered in class up through Chapter 12 in the\n",
    "Reek text (subject to what the project style guide says is good style).\n",
    "\n",
    "    • If your code compiles on Grace but not on the submit server, you may have changed the provided header files, which you were not supposed to do, or something in your account setup may be wrong. Run check-account-setup and come to the TAs’ office hours for help if you can’t fix any problems that it identifies on your own. (Other causes of this could be: you put your code in a subdirectory of the project06 directory, you added source or header files, or your Makefile is wrong, and you did not test it as described in Section 4.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    • The only “public” functions in string-graph.c are the ones whose prototypes already appear in the file string-graph.h. Any helper functions that you write will be “private”, so they should be declared static, and their prototypes should be placed at the top of string-graph.c, not in string-graph-datastructure.h. (And their prototypes should definitely not be put in string-graph.h, because if you modify it your code prob-ably won’t even compile on the submit server.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Make periodic backup copies of your project code! When you are getting close to being finished with the project, copy your entire project07 directory to one with a different name, so you have a copy of everything in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • For this project you will lose one point from your final project score for every submission that you make in excess of four submissions, for any reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Recall that all your projects must work on at least half of the public tests (by the end of the semester) in order for you to be eligible to pass the course. See the project policies handout for full details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • If you have a problem with your code and have to come to the TAs’ office hours for debugging help you must come with tests you have written yourself that illustrate the problem (not the public tests), what cases it occurs in, and what cases it doesn’t occur in. In particular you will need to show the smallest test you were able to write that illustrates the problem, so whatever the cause is can be narrowed down as much as possible before the TAs even start helping you. You must also have used the gdb debugger, explained in discussion section, and be prepared to show the TAs how you attempted to debug your program using it and what results you got.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize: the TAs will not look at your program’s results on any of\n",
    "the public tests in office hours. You must have written your own tests\n",
